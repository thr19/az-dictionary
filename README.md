## 📝 Project Description: Azerbaijani Dictionary Platform

**Azerbaijani Dictionary** is a privacy-first, modular web platform designed to preserve and empower the Azerbaijani language through rich lexical data and extensible grammar tools.

Built with a modern stack — Vue 3 + Vite + UnoCSS on the frontend, Fastify + SQLite on the backend, and Meilisearch for smart, typo-tolerant search — the platform offers fast, offline-friendly access to word definitions, synonyms, antonyms, suffixes, and grammatical insights.

Key features include:

- 🔍 **Smart Search**: Powered by Meilisearch for instant, fuzzy word lookup
- 📚 **Rich Word Data**: Definitions, part-of-speech, synonyms, antonyms, and suffix breakdowns
- 🧩 **Plugin Architecture**: Grammar rules and suffix analyzers loaded dynamically via backend plugins
- 🛠 **Admin Panel**: Role-based word editing and contribution system
- 🧠 **Suffix Intelligence**: Interactive grammar explanations for each suffix
- 🛡️ **Local-First Design**: SQLite-backed backend with privacy-focused architecture

The project is designed to scale into a community-driven linguistic platform, enabling contributors to extend functionality via plugins, enrich the lexicon, and explore dialects and etymology.

Whether you're a linguist, developer, or language enthusiast, this platform invites you to explore and shape the future of Azerbaijani language technology.
